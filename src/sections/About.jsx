        <p>
          I build clean, responsive websites and web apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and React, 
          and I‚Äôm comfortable on the backend with Python, PHP and MySQL.<b> I‚Äôve delivered real projects including 
          a WordPress e-commerce site (Yeti Fashion), a full-stack face-scan attendance system, and a full-stack complaint 
          management system.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          I know how to take an idea from design to a working product. I stay current with
           modern tools and best practices, focus on usability and performance, and deliver work on time.
            If you need a reliable developer to turn your requirements into a polished, maintainable solution,
             I‚Äôm ready to help.
